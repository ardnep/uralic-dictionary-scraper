# Uralic Etymology Dictionary Scraper

This repository contains code to scrape the [Uralic dictionary website](https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=\data\uralic\uralet&first=1) and obtain a list of all the Uralic words and their meanings stored in a excel file. 

This is a part of a computational linguistics research paper on deciphering ancient writing systems that I am currently working on.
